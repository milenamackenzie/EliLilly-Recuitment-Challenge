I had an error when setting up the environment for the challenge.
In the error it mentioned that a new upgrade of pip is available
I used this command : python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

After I tried running the environment again and a new error had popped up
The error told me that fastapi library for python was not installed
I then used this command: pip install fastapi

Once again, i tried setting the environment and it mentions in the error 
I would need to install uvicorn

Repeated setting up the environment and another error appeared
I would have to install install python-multipart
using this command : pip install python-multipart

After installing and updating everything, the environment was able to run.
